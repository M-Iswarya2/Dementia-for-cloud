            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                DementiaAI is dedicated to revolutionizing early dementia detection through 
                cutting-edge artificial intelligence and accessible screening tools. We believe 
                that early detection can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for 
                individuals at risk of cognitive decline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to make cognitive health screening as simple and routine as 
                checking your blood pressure, empowering individuals and healthcare providers 
                with actionable insights for proactive care.
